"""
find out how the map was established (Robo coordinates)
iterate through the relevant epochs
find grid points where MEP occured
for all pulses on that grid point compute features: cmc, phase, ...
compute feature ratios of MEP/NO_MEP and NO_MEP/MEP
for which feature do they effectively predict an MEP?
